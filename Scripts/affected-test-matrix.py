# Maps a list of changed files to the set of affected packages and emits TWO GitHub Actions job
# matrices: one for unit tests and one for UI tests. Used by .github/workflows/tests.yml so only the
# tests of packages whose code actually changed are run — and whenever a package's unit tests run, its
# UI tests do too. Each emitted job carries a `selfHosted` bool (see self-hosted-ci) that the
# workflow's `runs-on` uses to pick the self-hosted vs the GitHub-hosted runner.
#
# The logical sub-packages are defined in the repo-root packages.toml:
#   platforms      = the platforms its unit tests run on (subject to the temporary CI_PLATFORMS limit)
#   uiTests        = the platforms its UI tests run on, straight from the UITests project's Xcode config
#                    (NOT subject to CI_PLATFORMS — absent for packages with no UITests project)
#   self-hosted-ci = which test kinds run on the self-hosted runner (vs GitHub-hosted): a subset of
#                    ["unit", "ui"]. Optional; default ["ui"] (= today's behavior). Linux unit jobs
#                    always run on GitHub-hosted ubuntu regardless (the self-hosted runner is macOS).
# The dir -> package map used for change detection is derived from each package's targets+tests.
#
# Usage:
#   affected-test-matrix.py <changed-files.txt>     # one path per line; or the literal __ALL__
#   git diff --name-only A B | affected-test-matrix.py
#
# Emits (to stdout, GITHUB_OUTPUT format):
#   matrix={"include":[{"package":"SpeziAccount","platform":"macOS","selfHosted":false}, ...]}   # unit
#   ui_matrix={"include":[{"package":"SpeziViews","platform":"iOS","selfHosted":true}, ...]}      # UI
#   has_jobs=true|false
#   has_ui_jobs=true|false
#   affected=SpeziAccount,SpeziViews
