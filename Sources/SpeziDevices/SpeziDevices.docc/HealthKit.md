## Overview

SpeziDevices helps developers converting measurements received from Bluetooth devices to HealthKit sample types.

### Device Information

As soon as you conform your [SpeziBluetooth `BluetoothDevice`](../../SpeziBluetooth/SpeziBluetooth.docc/SpeziBluetooth.md)
to the ``HealthDevice`` protocol and implement the [`DeviceInformationService`](../../SpeziBluetoothServices/BluetoothServices.docc/BluetoothServices.md),
you can access the [`HKDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkdevice)
description using the ``HealthDevice/hkDevice-32s1d`` property

### Converting Measurements

SpeziDevices can convert your Bluetooth Health Measurement characteristics into HealthKit samples.
This is support for characteristics like [`BloodPressureMeasurement`](../../SpeziBluetoothServices/BluetoothServices.docc/BluetoothServices.md)
or [`WeightMeasurement`](../../SpeziBluetoothServices/BluetoothServices.docc/BluetoothServices.md).

Use methods like ``SpeziBluetoothServices/BloodPressureMeasurement/bloodPressureSample(source:)`` or
``SpeziBluetoothServices/WeightMeasurement/weightSample(source:resolution:)`` to convert these measurements to their respective HealthKit Sample
representation.

> Tip: By using the [`resource`](../../HealthKitOnFHIR/HealthKitOnFHIR.docc/HealthKitOnFHIR.md)
    provided through [`HealthKitOnFHIR`](../../HealthKitOnFHIR/HealthKitOnFHIR.docc/HealthKitOnFHIR.md) you can convert
    your Bluetooth measurements to [HL7 FHIR Observation Resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/observation.html).
