# Spezi Account


A Spezi framework that provides account-related functionality including login, sign up and password reset.

## Overview

The `SpeziAccount` framework fully abstracts setup and management of user account functionality for the
[Spezi](../Spezi/README.md) framework ecosystem.

|The `AccountSetup` is the central view for account onboarding, facilitating account login and creation. |The `SignupForm` is used by email-password-based AccountServices by default. |The `AccountOverview` is used to view and modify the user details of the currently associated account.|


The ``AccountSetup`` and ``AccountOverview`` views are central to `SpeziAccount`.
You use the ``AccountDetails`` collection within your views to visualize account information of the associated user account.

An ``AccountService`` provides an abstraction layer for managing different types of account management services
(e.g., email address and password-based service combined with an identity provider like Sign in with Apple).

For more information, please refer to the [API documentation](SpeziAccount.docc/SpeziAccount.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The [SpeziFirebase](../SpeziFirebase/README.md)
framework provides the `FirebaseAccountService`
you can use to configure an Account Service base on the Google Firebase service.


### Setup

Add the Spezi monorepo package to your app and select the `SpeziAccount` product.

In Xcode, select **File > Add Package Dependencies...**, enter:

```text
https://github.com/SchmiedmayerLab/Spezi.git
```

Choose **Up to Next Minor Version** and enter the latest tagged `0.x` release, for example `0.1.0`.

If you manage dependencies in a `Package.swift`, add the package dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SchmiedmayerLab/Spezi.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0"))
```

Then add the product dependency to the target that needs it:

```swift
.target(
    name: "MyApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "SpeziAccount", package: "Spezi")
    ]
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your application is not yet configured to use Spezi, follow the [Spezi setup article](../Spezi/Spezi.docc/Initial%20Setup.md) to set up the core Spezi infrastructure.

[Initial Setup](SpeziAccount.docc/Setup%20Guides/Initial%20Setup.md)
article provides a quick-start guide to set up `SpeziAccount` in your App.
Refer to the
[Implementing an Account Service](SpeziAccount.docc/AccountService/Creating%20your%20own%20Account%20Service.md)
article if you plan on implementing your own Account Service.

The Spezi Template Application provides a great starting point and example using the Spezi Account module.
